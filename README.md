## Welcome to Pre-CAT 

**Pre-CAT** is a preclinical CEST-MRI data analysis toolbox and Streamlit webapp. **Pre-CAT** was originally designed for processing cardiac and abdominal CEST acquisitions using the radial FLASH sequence described by Weigand-Whittier et al., but has been expanded for use with all ParaVision 6/7 CEST acqisitions.

> ⚠ **Note:**  
> **Pre-CAT** scripts rely on ParaVision method files with specific variable names. **Pre-CAT** is guaranteed to work with the cestsegCSUTE sequence, and should work with any CEST sequence based on the PV 6/7 MT module. **Pre-CAT** will *not* work with PV 360 acquisitions using the new CEST module. This may change in the future.

**Pre-CAT** processes and displays Z-spectra, Lorentzian difference plots, pixelwise maps, and field maps. Processed data is also saved in organized pickle files for downstream tasks.

## Requirements

A pre-prepared Conda environment is available in the `environment.yml` file. To install the environment, run:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pre-cat
```

Finally, [`BART`](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/) is also required. Please download the most recent version and follow the instructions in the **README** file for installation.

> ⚠ **Note for Mac Users:**  
> If you're using an **M1 Mac**, please follow the **MacPorts** version of the installation instructions for [`BART`](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/).

## Instructions

After activating the included Conda environment, navigate to the **Pre-CAT** directory and run:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

In-depth instructions are included in the Streamlit interface.

For users unfamiliar with murine and cardiac anatomy, instructions for cardiac ROI prescriptions are included [here](https://github.com/jweigandwhittier/Pre-CAT/blob/main/instructions/cardiac_rois.pdf).
